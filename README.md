This is Josh's word game
It's in python, so you'll need a python interpreter on your computer in order to run it.
If you can't run python files yet, then you might want to get the “Anaconda” Python distribution created by Continuum Analytics:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
After that, open Anaconda and use that to open Spider, an IDE where you can do stuff with Python.
Simply open the file ps4b.py and click run. You can then interact with the program in the shell and play the game.

If you don't want to use an IDE, just set your command line to the folder that has this repository and type: python ps4b.py
Of course you'll still need a python interpreter intalled on your machine.
Hopefully that command would run the game, and you can then respond to the prompts direclty in Terminal/Command Prompt.

If you decide the let the computer play, beware it is a really inefficient algorith, so it takes 45 seconds to come up with a word.
